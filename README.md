## Project Title: Spaceship Game
### Project Description
The Spaceship Game is a 2D game developed using Python. The game is a classic space-themed shooting game where the player controls a spaceship and fights against enemy spaceships to survive and score points. The game features a simple user interface, engaging gameplay, and challenging enemy spaceship AI.

### Technologies Used
Python
Pygame Library (https://www.pygame.org/)
### Features
1. Spaceship movement: The player can control the spaceship using keyboard inputs to move left, right, up, and down.
2. Shooting: The player can shoot bullets from the spaceship to destroy enemy spaceships.
3. Enemy Spaceships: The game features multiple enemy spaceships that move randomly and shoot bullets towards the player's spaceship.
4. Score and Lives: The player's score increases with each enemy spaceship destroyed, and the player starts with a certain number of lives. Lives are reduced when the player's spaceship is hit by enemy bullets, and the game ends when all lives are lost.
Game Over: When the game ends, the player is presented with a game over screen displaying their final score and an option to restart the game.
