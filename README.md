## Project Title: Spaceship Game
### Project Description
The Spaceship Game is a 2D game developed using Python. The game is a classic space-themed shooting game where the player controls a spaceship and fights against enemy spaceships to survive and score points. The game features a simple user interface, engaging gameplay, and challenging enemy spaceship AI.

### Technologies Used
